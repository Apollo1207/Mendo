    info: "95% of beer made in Ukraine is not beer. The product we are accustomed to calling it, is imposed on us by monopoly companies whose success is determined by the skill of marketers, not brewers. Our mission is to give people the opportunity to drink real beer. We believe that Lviv deserves its unique style recognized in the world. And we're working on creating that style! Our beer is already talked about in different countries and continents and so they learn about us, Lviv and Ukraine. The labels on our beer bottles carry messages about us all over the world. We brew the best breweries from Ukraine, Belgium, the Czech Republic and the USA. We experiment with flavors and ingredients. We are the only ones in Ukraine who brew beer with cones of fresh hops, elderflower or sunflower."

    info:"The authentic interior of the early 20th century and the original presentation of new Galician cuisine in the heart of Lviv - such as in April 2015 was presented to its guests by the Bachevsky Restaurant. Bachevskys today are a greenhouse, three floors with different halls, a terrace and a veranda, lunches accompanied by a harp, cello or piano and Bachevsky's Bar with the author's cocktail card, designed by the brand-bartender of Ivan Zelik restaurant.Here guests can sample over 50 kinds of various «nalyvka» and «nastoyanka», made according to the Baczewski family recipes. Homemade liqueurs («nalyvka») and digestifs («nastoyanka») are very popular in Western Ukraine. They are believed to be stomach-settling miracles after a heavy meal because of the soothing properties of their herbal mixtures. They are a touch sweet, intensely flavored, and often served chilled and sipped slowly. "
